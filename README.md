# Instant Messenger

This was meant to be an internet messenger app that ran on electron.

You can view the old but more functional version on the [legacy](https://github.com/afoster549/Instant-Messenger/tree/legacy) branch and the newer remake on the [main](https://github.com/afoster549/Instant-Messenger/tree/main) branch both an heavily unfinished.
